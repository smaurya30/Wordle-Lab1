- We have assumed there is a single hidden word "SONAR" defined in the program
- User is given 6 tries to guess the word
- After each guess, if the letter is not present in the word then it is assigned with color gray
- If it exists but is in the wrong position then it is assigned with color yellow
- If the letter is at the right position then it is assigned green
